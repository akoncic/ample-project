![Introduction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akoncic/ample-project/master/README/heading_introduction.png)

Each year 1.3 billion tons of food, about a third that is produced, is wasted, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. Meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition. That means one in nine people do not get enough food. Hunger and malnutrition are in fact the number one risk to health worldwide.

The good news is that hunger is entirely solvable. There is enough food in the world to feed everyone and no scientific breakthroughs are needed. Everyone can play a role in reducing food waste. Often with minimal effort.

Project goal is to provide a global, free and non-profit automated partnering platform for linking actors in the food surplus distribution process. Actor being individuals like you, retailers and food producers who have unsold food which would otherwise be discarded with people and charities who are in ever-growing need for food.

Simply put, our operation model is matching donor supply with recipient demand, as potential supply and demand often doesn't find each-other even if a potential donor and a potential recipient are very close to each-other.

![How it Works](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akoncic/ample-project/master/README/heading_how_it_works.png)

To redistribute the food, both donors and recipients should be subscribed to the service. Once donors announce the donation, donation is advertised on the system and the details are forwarded to potential recipients. When matches are created, the recipient gets in contact with the donor to arrange the logistics.
